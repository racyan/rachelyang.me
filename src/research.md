Rachel's research is in power electronics, a critical technology that provides power to anything requiring electricity. In particular, she specializes in magnetics design and modeling, with a focus on high-frequency power applications. Rachel works on improving the energy efficiency and density of magnetics, as they're often the bottleneck in advancing power electronics applications and in enabling new ones to emerge. 

Through her research thus far, Rachel has developed two types of magnetic component designs that can halve the energy loss of these components. These low-loss designs may help to drastically improve a wide range of power electronics applications, such as by reducing the energy used in manufacturing semiconductors or by accelerating the charging rate of wireless chargers.

Rachel is currently a graduate student researcher at MIT in Prof. David Perreault's [Power Electronics Research Group](https://www.rle.mit.edu/per/).

<!-- Rachel's research interests are in magnetics design and modeling, particularly for high-frequency power applications. Improving magnetic components' performance is crucial for advancing power electronics, as they're often the largest and lossiest parts in the system.  -->
