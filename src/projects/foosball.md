I designed and built a two-player tabletop foosball table, measuring 23" x 14" x 8.25". The table was designed for a 2-3-3-2 player set-up, with each team composed of five players. The goals are centered in the table, while the retrieval holes are shifted off-center to make it easier for players to retrieve the ball.

The table was designed in Autodesk Inventor. I then lasercut the table pieces out of 3/16" plywood and glued the pieces together. The foosball players are made out of square wooden dowels, and the players were screwed onto the 1/4" diameter aluminum rods. The bushings on the rods were custom designed in Autodesk Inventor and 3D printed.
