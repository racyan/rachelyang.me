I built the circuitry for an amplifier / speaker, and I both designed and built the case for it. The case was designed in Autodesk Inventor, a mechanical CAD software. Using the CAD model, I then laser cut the pieces of the case and assembled everything together. The entire case is held together using press-fit joints, i.e. no glue or other adhesive was used. 

The amplifier includes an SPST non-momentary toggle switch to turn power on and off. A blue LED at the top of the case lets the user know if the amplifier is on. A potentiometer is used for volume control. The amplifier also includes two inputs: a 3.5mm audio jack (for compatibility with phones and similar devices) and a 6.3mm jack (for compatibility with guitars and other electric instruments).
