## MIT Tech Theater: Frosh Part 1

_Synopsis:_ Freshman Daisy arrives at MIT eager for the college experience. With her new friends Charlotte and Steven, Daisy tries to survive her overwhelming class load, look cool in front of her crush, and make a few bucks putting together videos on alcohol and drug awareness. But as the pressure to do well in school and maintain a social life builds, one of them looks to substances for comfort, and the trio's friendship becomes strained. A **one-act play** about freshman friends navigating their first semester in college through laughter and tears, trying to handle relationship and friendship troubles amidst the complexities of alcohol and drug use.

**Commissioned** by MIT Alcohol & Other Drugs Services (AODS) for MIT's Freshman Orientation in 2019.

## Tactless

_Synopsis:_ In a society where people use Tacts to communicate and interact with the world, Callie struggles to live without them. While everyone else discriminates against Callie for being Tactless, her best friend Quinn keeps life bearable. But when Callie is finally given the opportunity to get Tacts, tragedy befalls Quinn. Now, she must decide whether to put her own needs before her friend's. A **one-act play** about the give-and-take in relationships.

Developed through the MIT Theater Arts Playwrights' Lab.

**Awarded** the [Boit Manuscript Prize](https://cmsw.mit.edu/publications/ilona-karmel-writing-prizes/) in Drama in 2018.
