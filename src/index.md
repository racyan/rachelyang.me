Rachel Yang (she/her) is an electrical engineer, researcher, writer, and science communicator. 

For research, Rachel works in power electronics, a field focused on making sure that anything that requires electricity gets the type of power it needs. Specifically, she works on magnetic components that help convert power between different types by temporarily storing energy. She aims to make magnetics more energy efficient and smaller, and is generally interested in anything related to magnetism.

Rachel also strives to get people excited about science and to make STEM more accessible. She is a freelance science writer and is currently a writing intern at MIT News. In the past, she was a script writer for [_SCFG Live!_](https://www.scienceclubforgirls.org/scfglive), an online STEM education show for kids, hosted by the Science Club for Girls. Rachel also co-teaches a workshop series on science communication at MIT. 

As an electrical engineer, Rachel has worked on the [Xbox Adaptive Controller](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/garage/wall-of-fame/xbox-adaptive-controller/), the Xbox One S, the Xbox One X, and the Microsoft HoloLens.

Rachel is currently working on her PhD in electrical engineering at MIT. She holds a master's degree in electrical engineering, and a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering and theater arts.
