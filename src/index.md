Rachel Yang (she/her) is an electrical engineer, researcher, writer, and science communicator. 

For research, Rachel works on power electronics, a critical technology that provides power to anything requiring electricity, from smartphones to electric vehicles. She works to make power electronics more energy efficient and more energy dense by improving their most limiting parts: the magnetic components. By developing better magnetic components, Rachel hopes to help advance technology for a more sustainable society, such as by reducing the energy consumption of power-hungry data centers or by accelerating the development of electrified aircraft.

<!-- For research, Rachel works on power electronics, a technology that helps anything requiring electricity get the type of power it needs, from smartphones and laptops to homes and schools. Specifically, she focuses on improving the energy efficiency and energy density of a class of components used in power electronics called magnetic components. Right now, magnetic components are often the most energy inefficient and largest parts in power electronics, hindering the capabilities of many technologies, such as electric vehicles or data centers. Improving these components could, for example, extend the battery life in EVs for longer driving range or reduce the electricity usage of data centers for a smaller carbon footprint. Because of this, Rachel aims to make magnetic components more energy efficient and smaller. -->

 <!-- Often, the type of power that's needed is not the type of power that's available, so these components help convert power between different types by using magnetic energy. -->
 
Besides research, Rachel loves helping other scientists and engineers improve their communication skills. She is a Communication Fellow at the [MIT EECS Communication Lab](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/eecs/), where she coaches undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs on technical communication skills. In the past, Rachel has co-taught a workshop series on science communication to STEM graduate students and postdocs at MIT. 

Rachel also strives to spark interest in science and to make STEM more accessible. Currently, she is a script writer and editor at [TED-Ed](https://www.youtube.com/@TEDEd), where she works on animated videos about science. She is also a fact-checker for the popular science YouTube channel [SciShow](https://www.youtube.com/scishow). Previously, Rachel has interned as a science writer at MIT News. 

As an electrical engineer, Rachel has worked on the [Xbox Adaptive Controller](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/garage/wall-of-fame/xbox-adaptive-controller/), the Xbox One S, the Xbox One X, and the Microsoft HoloLens 2.

Rachel is currently working on her PhD in electrical engineering at MIT. She holds a master's degree in electrical engineering and a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering and theater arts.
