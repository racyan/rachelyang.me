Rachel Yang (she/her) is an electrical engineer, researcher, writer, and science communicator. 

For research, Rachel works on power electronics, which are electronics that help anything requiring electricity get the type of power it needs, including cellphones, homes, and electric vehicles. Specifically, she focuses on improving the magnetic components used in power electronics, which help convert power between different types by temporarily storing and releasing energy. Magnetics are often the largest and lossiest parts in power electronics, so Rachel aims to make them more energy efficient and smaller.

Besides research, Rachel strives to get people excited about science and to make STEM more accessible. She is a science writer and has previously interned at MIT News. Currently, she is a fact-checker at the YouTube channel [SciShow](https://www.youtube.com/scishow), a daily popular science show. 

Rachel also loves helping other scientists and engineers improve their communication skills. She is a Communication Fellow at the [MIT EECS Communication Lab](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/eecs/), where she coaches undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs on technical communication skills. In the past, Rachel has co-taught an annual workshop series on science communication to STEM graduate students and postdocs at MIT. 

As an electrical engineer, Rachel has worked on the [Xbox Adaptive Controller](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/garage/wall-of-fame/xbox-adaptive-controller/), the Xbox One S, the Xbox One X, and the Microsoft HoloLens.

Rachel is currently working on her PhD in electrical engineering at MIT. She holds a master's degree in electrical engineering, and a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering and theater arts.
