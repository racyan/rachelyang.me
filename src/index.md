Rachel Yang (she/her) is an electrical engineer, researcher, writer, and science communicator. 

For research, Rachel works on power electronics, a technology that helps anything requiring electricity get the type of power it needs, from smartphones and laptops to homes and schools. Specifically, she focuses on improving a category of components used in power electronics called magnetic components. Right now, magnetic components are often the most energy inefficient and largest parts in power electronics, hindering the capabilities of many technologies, such as electric vehicles or data centers. Improving these components could, for example, extend the battery life in EVs for longer driving range or reduce the electricity usage of data centers for a smaller carbon footprint. Because of this, Rachel aims to make magnetic components more energy efficient and smaller.

 <!-- Often, the type of power that's needed is not the type of power that's available, so these components help convert power between different types by using magnetic energy. -->
 
Besides research, Rachel strives to get people excited about science and to make STEM more accessible. She is a science writer and has previously interned at MIT News. Currently, she is a fact-checker for the YouTube channel [SciShow](https://www.youtube.com/scishow), a daily popular science show. 

Rachel also loves helping other scientists and engineers improve their communication skills. She is a Communication Fellow at the [MIT EECS Communication Lab](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/eecs/), where she coaches undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs on technical communication skills. In the past, Rachel has co-taught an annual workshop series on science communication to STEM graduate students and postdocs at MIT. 

As an electrical engineer, Rachel has worked on the [Xbox Adaptive Controller](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/garage/wall-of-fame/xbox-adaptive-controller/), the Xbox One S, the Xbox One X, and the Microsoft HoloLens.

Rachel is currently working on her PhD in electrical engineering at MIT. She holds a master's degree in electrical engineering, and a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering and theater arts.
