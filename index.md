Hi, my name is Rachel Yang. I am currently an undergraduate studying electrical engineering and computer science at MIT. My research interests include power magnetics and power electronics. In my free time, I enjoy being involved in many backstage aspects of theater productions, ranging from stage managing to producing to video designing. 

Due to my love for both technology and the arts, I am interested in working on projects at the intersection between the two areas. In the past, I've had the opportunity to work on cool products that fit my interests, including the Xbox and the HoloLens. Going forward, I hope to continue working on projects that allow me to leverage my technical skills within the entertainment and arts sphere.
