The first cake I designed structural supports for was a fairly standard three-tiered cake. To support the weight of the cake, dowels that were the height of each tier were used to distribute the weight from one wooden plate to the next. A four-legged stand was used to support the entire weight of the cake.

The second cake I designed supports for was a T. rex made out of rice krispies. I designed an internal support structure made out of wood and laser cut the pieces. The joints were designed to press fit together so that no adhesive was needed. In addition, there were wooden blocks embedded in the cake pieces underneath the T. rex's feet and tail to support the weight and prevent the T. rex from crushing the cake.
