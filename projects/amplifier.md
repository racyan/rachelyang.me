I built the circuitry for an amplifier / speaker, and I both designed and built the case for it. The case was designed in Autodesk Inventor, a mechanical CAD software. Using the CAD model, I then laser cut the pieces of the case and assembled everything together. The entire case is held together using press-fit joints, i.e. no glue or other adhesive was used. An LED at the top of the case lets the user know if the amplifier is on. 

Skills used: Autodesk Inventor, laser cutting, soldering
